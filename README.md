📌 Project Title:
Explore Countries – Country Info Web App

🧠 Objective:
To build a modern, responsive web application using public APIs that displays useful, real-time information about countries in an interactive, animated interface using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

🔧 Technologies Used:
Tool/Library	Purpose
HTML5	Structure of the website
CSS + Tailwind CSS	UI styling and layout
JavaScript (ES6+)	Functionality & API interaction
REST Countries API	Fetch real-time country data

📈 Key Features:
🌍 Country Search: Users can search for a country and view its basic info (population, capital, region) with an auto-generated summary.

🧭 Region Filter: Dropdown lets users browse countries by region.

🎨 Animated About Page: Cards animate into view using @keyframes fade and slide effects.

🖥️ Fully Responsive: Works across all screen sizes and devices.

🔗 Multi-page Navigation: Includes Home, About, and Contact pages.

📝 Contact Form: Simple form UI for user interaction.

🚀 How It Works:
On page load, JavaScript fetches country data from the REST Countries API.

On search or region select, data is filtered and displayed dynamically.

About page uses custom CSS animations to reveal feature highlight cards.

All UI components use Tailwind CSS for rapid and elegant styling.

🧪 Testing:
✅ Mobile and desktop responsive design tested.

✅ Search function tested with multiple edge cases.

✅ API failure fallback and loading errors are handled.

📂 Future Improvements:
🌐 Add Dark Mode toggle

🔍 Add fuzzy search with autocomplete

📊 Include more detailed data (GDP, currency, languages)

🔐 Backend for storing contact form responses
